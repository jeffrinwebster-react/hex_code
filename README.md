Features Implemented

Tabs: Created a responsive tab component allowing easy navigation between different sections.
Carousel: Implemented a dynamic carousel for image or content display.
Other Components: Input,date,Card.


Approach

Technologies Used:

React.js: For creating interactive and reusable components.
React Router: For navigation between different views (if applicable).
CSS: For styling, with Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts.
JavaScript (ES6+ features): For writing logic and handling events.
React Hooks: For managing state and side effects in functional components.
styled-components for style purpose.
Ensured mobile responsiveness using media queries.
Focused on modular and reusable components.
Used semantic HTML for better accessibility.


Challenges Faced:

Implementing the tabs and carousel components required additional research. Finding the right libraries for smooth transitions and ensuring cross-browser compatibility took more time than initially anticipated.
Optimizing the performance of the carousel for faster loading times and smoother animations.

Additional Notes:
Given more time, I would refine the design and add extra features like accessibility improvements, form validation, and advanced animations.
Iâ€™ve ensured that the components are flexible and can be reused in different parts of the application.
